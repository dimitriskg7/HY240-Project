# HY240-Project

### Data Structures Class

In this project we were asked to simulate the game called Among Us.

The project was split in two phases.

In the first we used data structures like doubly circular linked lists, stacks.

In the second phase, we used binary search trees, hashmaps and hash functions, a Heap etc.
